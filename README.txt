This repository contains my Vim RC file. Over the last 3 years, I have set it up the way I like my VIM to work. 

This VIMRC file may have settings which are applicable only on Windows. Please be careful before copying it on your machine. 

But yeah, read through it and steal anything which you like, good luck.
